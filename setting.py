rank_prompt_template = """
You are an expert assistant tasked with evaluating how relevant a paragraph is in answering a specific question.

Please read the **Question** and the **Paragraph**, and then return a structured result with:

1. `relevance_score`: an integer between 0 and 5 indicating how well the paragraph answers the question:
    - 0: Not relevant at all
    - 1: Slightly relevant
    - 2: Somewhat relevant
    - 3: Moderately relevant
    - 4: Very relevant
    - 5: Completely relevant

2. `justification`: a short explanation of why you assigned that score.

Your response must match the expected format of a structured object with these two fields.

question_to_query_prompt_template = """
You are a biomedical search assistant specialized in crafting precise PubMed search queries. 

Your task is to convert a user's natural language question into a **valid and effective** PubMed query. Use combinations of:
- Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT),
- MeSH terms (if appropriate),
- Field tags like [Title/Abstract] or [MeSH Terms] or [All Fields].

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Guidelines:
- DO NOT create made-up or overly long quoted phrases unless you're sure they are valid MeSH terms or commonly indexed phrases.
- Instead of quoting complex phrases (e.g., "autoimmune encephalitis, pediatric"), split them into simpler concepts using AND/OR.
- Use parentheses to organize logic clearly.
- Use synonyms to broaden coverage if appropriate.
- Apply filters like humans, language, or age only when clearly implied by the question.
